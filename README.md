## üí° Short Explanation
The library is a place that provides many books of knowledge, novels and various types of books. Many people want to borrow books to read at home or elsewhere.
Loaning data recording manually is considered less efficient and takes a long time. For this reason, E-Library was created as a data management software for borrowing library books. It is hoped that this application can help manage and speed up the process of borrowing and returning books.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Used
| Python      | MySQL      |  Sublime Text     |

This application is built using the python programming language with a mysql database to store borrowing data and returning books. The framework used to create desktop applications is wxpython.

## üßë‚Äçüéì What we learned 
Using wxpython has very little documentation in the language. We needed to learn the wxpython framework for quite some time through trial and error. In addition, query processing in python and mysql is quite complex with many tables that are connected to one another. We also use the object oriented programming (OOP) paradigm during application development.
